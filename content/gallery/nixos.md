As with LaTeX, I found out about NixOS during a Wikipedia Binge, and decided to try it as I have been vaguely involved in the Linux Desktop scene for about 11 Years.  As such, the idea of a Functional Paradigm based Package Management System was certainly interesting, and since I had recently fubar'd my Ubuntu Install (due to not understanding DKMS modules and the fact that ZFS on Ubuntu was reliant on them), I thought I'd give NixOS a try.
