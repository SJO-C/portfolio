#   Changes order: The newest item will be displayed first in the gallery. 
#   Just like Hugo's natural ordering, this is anti-chronological.
#   You can use 'weight' to order (primarily) for more control (sometimes it makes sense to put old items before new ones).
#   The specifics are documented here: https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/#order-content

As with LaTeX, I found out about NixOS during a Wikipedia Binge, and decided to try it as I have been vaguely involved in the Linux Desktop scene for about 11 Years.  As such, the idea of a Functional Paradigm based Package Management System was certainly interesting, and since I had recently fubar'd my Ubuntu Install (due to not understanding DKMS modules and the fact that ZFS on Ubuntu was reliant on them), I thought I'd give NixOS a try.

When I initally installed NixOS, I depended on the Web Manual, and had to do most of the Install Process, drive petitioning etc. in the Terminal.  Thankfully, NixOS's documentation is well written and easy to understand.  From that point, I became fairly quickly accustomed to using the `/etc/nixos/configuaration.nix` file for system and package management, such as setting up Docker and nVidia drivers.  I even went as far as to install most software via a very, very long list in my `configuration.nix` file, such as my desktop environments (Gnome & CDE) and configure `sudo` to insult me if my password is wrong.  Ulitmately, my use of NixOS hasn't extended to learning the Nix language too much as I seldom have needed to try to make my own flakes or generate derivations for pre-existing packages.
