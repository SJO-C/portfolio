I began to try Proxmox in late 2023, as to learn how to use a Hypervisor, and given that Proxmox has a free tier (which is more or less the same as the paid edition), Proxmox seemed like a good choice to learn the ropes of Type #1 Hypervisors.  

I am still largely at the beginning with Proxmox, and have only lightly experimented clusters, and am yet to try the Ceph File System.  Despite this, I do feel comfortable with the Proxmox browser GUI, and as Proxmox is Debian based, I feel comfortable doing basic Hypervisor OS admin, like Package Updates and basic File System Admin.  

For part of 2023, I did use Proxmox to Virtualise a OPNSense Router, but this was later removed from 'production' owing to apparently undiagnosable issues with a Sky Q Satellite TV STB.  I suspect this was more likely related to the STB taking issue with the TP_Link Network Switch, as there are plenty of reports of Sky equipment behaving oddly on networks using TP_Link Equipment.
