In late 2022, I applied and was subsequently recruited as a student consultant to a joint project between my Institution's (University of Lincoln) [Lincoln Academy of Learning & Teaching](https://lalt.lincoln.ac.uk) and my Institution's [Students' Union](https://lincolnsu.com/home), called the Student Futures Manifesto Project, a project that had been proposed by the [UPP Foundation](https://upp-foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Student-Futures-Manifesto-Final-Report-of-the-Student-Futures-Commission.pdf) to try to mitigate the impact the COVID-19 Pandemic had on higher education.  Lincoln was one of 20 such Institutions in the UK to partake, and I was one of Six Students within Lincoln who acted as consultants to the project.  

Specifically, I focussed on [Support for Students before they reach University](https://lalt.lincoln.ac.uk/files/2024/02/V72-2.-IMPact-SFM-Theme-1-5934ee852837c5ed.pdf) and worked hand in hand with Ian Snowley (the Dean of Learning Skills and University Librarian), to produce my report.  The report linked above is the result of both Surveys & Focus Groups and is now in its Phase II, in which the recommendations that myself and the other five student consultants proposed are now being tested ready for implementation.

The reports are now available in the University of Lincoln's LALT e-Journal IMPact (vol. 7 issue 2).
